### Mission
This program for Android is created for writing, encryption, and decryption of texts in the photonic language (my conlang)

## How to install?
I don't have an .apk file yet, sooo... you can either run the program through Godot and use it that way, or compile the .apk yourself and install it on your phone if you want

To do this, follow these key steps:
1. download this repository, enter the command below in the terminal (you must have git installed):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/F0ront/FotonWriter-Android-.git
   ```
2. open the project folder with Godot and run (it is recommended to use the latest version of Godot)

**If you want to compile to .apk** use the official guide from the Godot developers at [this link](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html)

## How to use?
The program has two main menus, for editing text and for encrypting/decrypting it. You can switch between them using the buttons at the top of the screen.

Both menus have a built-in specific keyboard, the bottom 4 keys are: cursor left, space, backspace, cursor right, respectively. The rest of the buttons are symbols.

The editing menu also has a row of buttons above the keyboard, these are theme change, opening the settings menu, and a button to hide/show the keyboard.

There are two themes, rounded (set by default) and sharp. Themes apply to all program elements, including text. However, they do not affect the text itself. Text files always represent only ASCII characters, all the magic is just special fonts :3

In the settings menu you can change the text size and interface language. On other tabs you can see links and read about the program.

In the encryption/decryption menu, you enter the key in the line, and after pressing the button to the right of the line (arrow, pointing with its wide side), the decrypted or encrypted text will be displayed.
